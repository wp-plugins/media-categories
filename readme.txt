== Description ==

By default, Wordpress doesn't allow for categorising attachments - just posts.  This plugin adds a category selection field to the attachment management interface.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the extracted plugin folder and contained files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory - you should have a folder /wp-content/plugins/attachment-categories/ with the file attachment-categories.php in it
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
